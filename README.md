This demo Flutter App demonstrate some of the standard architecture practice using Provider, Firebase Database, GetIt, Injectable, BuiltValue, Dio, Frezzed with the usage of lots of code generator libs. Feel free to checkout with keeping in mind that work is under progress. ;)

Also, I have made service locator in a way that dependencies can be passed based on selected environment either dev or prod using abstract class and its implementation.
